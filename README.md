# Why

~~I hate myself~~ To win. So basically... the claw needs to be fast and auto orienting

## How

As the Silver Wolves put it...

- Camera with wide FOV
- Colour mask
- Contour
- Min Area Bounding Rectangle
- Angle
- Servo rotation

### Webcam Info

We need a webcan with a wide FOV (Silver Wolves use one with 120 degrees) mounted at approx 20cm above the ground. Ideally it will be parallel with the ground and have a constant height to make location based calculations easier.

In addition to this, we need to remove the fish eye distortion from the camera to allow for accurate position calculations relative to the camera position. This can be done with calibration externally with a laptop and a checkerboard pattern. Ask ChatGPT for more info.
